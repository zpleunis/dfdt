# dfdt
Measure a linear drift rate for a fast radio burst, (for now) using a 2D auto-correlation analysis and Monte Carlo resampling. Different methods might be added in the future.

## Method

A 2D auto-correlation analysis for measuring linear drift rates was first used by [Hessels et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...876L..23H/abstract).
The addition of Monte Carlo resampling has been developed to analyze CHIME/FRB bursts, and it has so far been used in [CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...885L..24C/abstract) and [Fonseca et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891L...6F/abstract). More details are provided in my [PhD thesis](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752n54q), the relevant sections of which are extracted and put into the `docs` directory here. The `docs` also contain a video that illustrates the drift rate definition, as well as a Jypter notebook used to make the video.

## Installation

- Download source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/zpleunis/dfdt.git
```
- Install in develop mode:
```
cd dfdt/
python setup.py develop [--user]
```

## Usage

The `data` directory contains a dedispersed waterfall from repeating sources of FRBs 180916.J0158+65 as detected by CHIME/FRB. After installing `dfdt` you can measure the drift rate in this burst using:
```python

import numpy as np

import dfdt

fname = "[path to package]/dfdt/data/23891929_DM348.8_waterfall.npy"
dedispersed_intensity = np.load(fname)

# burst parameters
dm_uncertainty = 0.2  # pc cm-3
source = "R3"
eventid = "23891929"

# instrument parameters
dt_s = 0.00098304
df_mhz = 0.0244140625
nchan = 16384
freq_bottom_mhz = 400.1953125
freq_top_mhz = 800.1953125

ds = dfdt.DynamicSpectrum(dt_s, df_mhz, nchan, freq_bottom_mhz, freq_top_mhz)

constrained, dfdt_data, dfdt_mc, dfdt_mc_low, dfdt_mc_high = dfdt.ac_mc_drift(
    dedispersed_intensity, dm_uncertainty, source, eventid, ds,
    dm_trials=100, mc_trials=100
)
```
The output of a run, two diagnostic figures and a `.npz` file with all the drift rates, with 100x100=10,000 Monte Carlo trials is saved into a `results` directory here. For explanations of the diagnostic figures see the `docs` directory. See the docstring of the `ac_mc_drift()` function for more details.
